# EVM Subnet Setup Tutorial for Avalanche

Welcome to this exciting challenge! In this tutorial, you'll learn how to set up your very own EVM subnet on Avalanche, which serves as an excellent starting point for building your DeFi Kingdom clone. We'll guide you through creating and deploying a custom subnet, and then deploying two smart contracts onto it: an ERC20 token contract and a Vault contract. These contracts will serve as the foundational building blocks for your DeFi Kingdom clone, allowing you to explore the exciting world of decentralized finance and take your first steps towards building your very own DeFi empire. Let's get started!

## Your Project: Step by Step

1. **Deploy your EVM subnet using the Avalanche CLI**: Follow the instructions provided to deploy your custom EVM subnet using the Avalanche Command Line Interface (CLI).

2. **Add your Subnet to Metamask**: Add your newly deployed subnet to Metamask for easy interaction.

3. **Make sure it is your selected network in Metamask**: Ensure that your subnet is selected as the current network in Metamask.

4. **Connect Remix to your Metamask**: Connect Remix, an online Solidity IDE, to your Metamask using the Injected Provider.

5. **Deploy the smart-contracts**: Use Remix to deploy the ERC20 token contract and the Vault contract onto your EVM subnet.

6. **Test your application!**: Utilize Remix to interact with your deployed smart contracts, deploy tokens, pools, and more. Test the functionality of your DeFi Kingdom clone to ensure everything is working as expected.
